======================================================================

The files included as part of it include
* porta library
* blockdev library
* fatfs library
* TiDMxxx support library

The implementation tries to strike a balance between speed and memory.
So there are some restrictions at places whose boundries can be pushed
to either side flexibly as required by changing defines in the code.

This can be used from within a linux application in userspace independent
of the linux kernel support for ATA devices and FatFs. However care should
be taken so that linux kernel doesn't manage theses at the same time. One
way is to tell the kernel hdxyz=none during booting.


Tests
------
I have tested these logic on 
* a simulated file based Block Device
* HDD of emulators like bosch, qemu and vmware
* HDD of PCs
* HDD and CF of few Arm based Portable Media solutions
Both Fat16 and Fat32 has been tested.


INSTALL
--------
* For building library for use by others
  make release
  cd RELEASEPATH\src
  make -- to build the test application
* For building library and test app for own tests
  make
