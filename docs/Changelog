Changelog - fatfs
C Hanish Menon <hanishkvc>
---------------------------

22july2004
* Made testfat functions use uc pointer as one of their arguments.
  So that we can test/work with multiple fat filesystems in a given run.


21july2004-2200 (what I remember now)
* Interactive menu added to testfat
* Partition support in loadfile functions (i.e adding used partitions baseSec)
* Updated the logic such that they no longer use global structures instead 
  * all fatfs calls use a TFat structure which inturn gets its buffers
    set from a TFatBuffers structure defined by user.
  * and all fatuc calls use the TFatFsUserContext structure which inturn
    as a pointer to the TFat it is using.


20july2004-2300 (what I remember now)
* Added support for reading files with clusSize granularity (loadfileclus).
  Also a separate function is provided so that the application can verify 
  if the buffer it has is ok with this loadfileclus function.
* Added some utility functions for strcpy, memcpy, token parsing
* current path string is maintained in UserContext
* each logic of testfat is timed with added helper routines
* File extraction logic added to testfat
* new dirlisting (inefficient(toShowOthersHowItCouldBe)) logic added



ToDo
------
* Provide util function for strcmp
* make blockdev data and functions part of a struct and have it embedded in
  TFat structure.
* Remove the forced Unicode to Ascii string conversion in getfileinfo
  and provide routine to convert given ascii string to unicode, so that
  we can always maintain unicode string in lfn of TFileInfo.
