---------------------------

20july2004-2300 (what I remember now)
* Added support for reading files with clusSize granularity.

21july2004-2200 (what I remember now)
* Updated the logic such that they no longer use global structures instead 
  * all fatfs calls use a TFat structure which inturn gets its buffers
    set from a TFatBuffers structure defined by user.
  * and all fatuc calls use the TFatFsUserContext structure which inturn
    as a pointer to the TFat it is using.
